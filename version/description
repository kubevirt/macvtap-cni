v0.10.0
Version v0.9.0 unfortunately broke the device-plugin registration for k8s-1.25
instead of fixing it.
This new version actually fixes the device-plugin registration order, and also
fixes a nil pointer that was causing the macvtap-cni pods to crash-loop. 

Features:
* build, vendor: bump to k8s-1.24
Bugs:
* device plugin: fix registration order for k8s-1.25
* Fix nil pointer error for k8s 1.25
